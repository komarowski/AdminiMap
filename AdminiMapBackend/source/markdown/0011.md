## Overview

The height of the peak Three Brothers is 2860 meters. From the top of the Three Brothers, a stunning view of Almaty opens up. Unfortunately, most of the time of the year there is smog over the city, which spoils the picture a little.

On the way to the top, there is the Kok-Zhailau plateau - a very popular place for outdoor recreation among Almaty residents. Therefore, it is better to walk along this route on weekdays, otherwise you will have to go in a string of people.
