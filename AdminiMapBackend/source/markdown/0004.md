## Overview
The Esentai River divides Almaty approximately in half. In the city, the banks and river beds are concreted in the form of the thresholds. More or less equipped embankment stretches for 12 kilometers.

In the upper part of the city, the embankment is a continuous pedestrian zone with benches, children's and sports grounds and picturesque mountain views.
