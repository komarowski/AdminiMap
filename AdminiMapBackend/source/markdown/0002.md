## Overview

Almaty is a key financial center in Central Asia. It is home to Halyk Bank, which is the largest bank in Central Asia, Kaspi Bank, and other major banks. Almaty generates approximately 20% of Kazakhstan's GDP.

I decided to mark the place on the map where the offices of many large companies in Kazakhstan are located. Here you can get acquainted with the modern architecture of Almaty.
